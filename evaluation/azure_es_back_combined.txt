DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES ---------------------- At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was located near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 83.9 West. Helene is moving north-northeast near 24 mph (39 km/h).  One shift to the north is expected during the night, occupying the center Georgia.  The center of the hurricane should make landfall very soon in the Big Bend region of Florida.  After touching land, Helene is expected to turn to the northwest and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.   Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher winds Bursts.  Helene is an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane  the Saffir-Simpson hurricane-force wind scale.  Weakening expected  after Helene moves inland, but the rapid forward speed will allow  strong and damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well  across the southeastern United States, including over the  higher ground in southern Appalachia.   Hurricane-force winds extend up to 60 miles (95 km) from the Center, tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km).  A sustained wind of 64 mph (103 km/h) with gusts of up to 84 mph  A speed of 135 km/h was recently reported in Cedar Key, Florida.

When the eye passes by, people are reminded not to Venture into the relative calm, as dangerous winds will increase very quickly when the eye passes.  Tropical storm conditions are that occur in South and Central Florida, and these conditions continue to spread northward through tropical storm warning areas in the southeastern U.S. through early Friday morning.  Strong Damaging winds, especially in gusts, are likely to penetrate up to inland as the highest terrain in southern Appalachia.   PRECIPITATION: Over portions of southeastern U.S. to the south Appalachia, Helene is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This The rains are likely to cause catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant river floods. Numerous major landslides are expected in rugged terrain across southern Appalachia.

ZCZC MIATCDAT4 ALL TTAA00 KNHC Human Rights   Hurricane Helene Discussion Number 15 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami, FL AL092024 1100 PM EDT Thu 26 Sep 2024   Hurricane is about to make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region.  Timely Hurricane Observations from the Air Force and NOAA Hunter aircraft demonstrated that Helene continued to strengthen rapidly before it approached the coast, with the central pressure falling at about 3 MB per hour, as Late.  The aircraft's maximum flight-level winds of 700 mb were 136 kt, which corresponds to an intensity of about 120 kt, which could Be a little conservative.  Radar and satellite imagery show numerous mesocyclones that rotate around the wall of the eye.   The Great Hurricane Continues to Move Rapidly North-Northeast with the last initial movement estimated at 015/21 kt.  One In general, a northward trajectory is expected during the night, taking the center from south to north Georgia through early Friday morning. Later on Friday and Saturday, Helene should slow down considerably while it interacts with a mid-level low to the northwest and west. The weakened system is likely to become nearly stationary at 48-60 hours.  The official track forecast follows the dynamic model consensus.   Although the system will weaken as it moves over the earth, the speed of the system will be Helene's forward speed for the next 12 hours or so at an inland end with strong winds over parts of the southeastern United States, particularly over Georgia, including strong gusts over the higher ground of southern Appalachia. As a result, a higher-than-normal burst factor is indicated in the official forecast while Helene is inland.   KEY MESSAGES:   1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is occurring along parts of the of Florida's Big Bend coast, where flooding could reach up to about 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There it is also a danger of life-threatening storm surges along the rest off the west coast of the Florida peninsula.   2. Catastrophic hurricane-force winds are occurring near the coast inside the wall of Helene's eye and extend inland over portions of northern Florida and southern Georgia.   3. Harmful wind gusts will penetrate well inland over parts of the Georgia and the Carolinas tonight, particularly over the southern Appalachian terrain. Residents in these areas must be prepared for the possibility of long-lasting power Interruptions.  If you use a generator after the storm, make sure it's placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages to prevent deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.   4. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, including numerous significant landslides, is expected across parts of southern Appalachia through Friday. Considerable locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding are likely to northwest and north Florida and the southeast through Friday. Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major rivers Flooding is likely.
