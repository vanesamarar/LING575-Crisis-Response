ZCZC MIATCDAT4 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM   Hurricane Helene Discussion Discussion Number 15 NWS National Hurricane Miami FL AL092024 1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 26 2024   The storm is moving to Florida Big Bend state.  Suggested Attention from Air Force and Typhoon NOAA Hunter's aircraft showed that Helene had intensified quickly to their Rank Category 4 status before approaching the coast, with their central pressure falling at about 3 mb per hour since since in the afternoon.  Peak 700 mb flight-level wind from the aircraft were 136 kt, corresponding to the intensity of about 120 kt, which may be a bit conservative.  Radar and satellite images show a large number of mesocyclones that surrounded the eye wall.   The great storm continues apace in the northeast with rapidly with the last previous motion estimated at 015/21 kt.  A generally the northbound road is expected at night, and the facility is being taken from southern to northern Georgia through early Friday morning. Later on Friday and Saturday, Helene should be substantially reduced Where it interacts with low-lying low-levels to the northwest and west. A weakening system may be almost almost tied to 48-60 for hours.  The official track prediction follows the dynamical model consensus.   Although the system weakens as it moves over the ground, quick helene's forward speed during the next 12 hours or so will result that the earthquakes far inland with strong winds passed through parts of the southeastern United States, especially Georgia, including a bit stronger in the highlands of the southern Appalachians. Thus daraeded, a factor a higher-than-normal gust factor is indicated in the the official projection while Helene is inside.   IMPORTANT MESSAGES:   1. The rise of the catastrophic and deadly storm is happening in different parts in the Florida Big Bend coast, where fatigue can reach as high of 20 feet above the ground, along with destructive waves.  It is it is also a risk of a dangerous storm in the remainder the west coast of florida island.   2-Severe and catastrophic storm winds are occurring near the coast Inside helene's source columns extending inside parts of north Florida and southern Georgia.   3. Damaging winds storm well will enter more inland than parts of Georgia and the Carolinas tonight, especially on the high rise land of the southern Appalachians. Residents living in these areas must be prepared for the possibility of long-term power outages.  If you use a generator after the storm, make sure it is put outdoors at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages to avoid fatal carbon monoxide poisoning.   4. Catastrophic flash that threatens life and floods in the city, including many large earthquakes, expected to end parts of the appalachians south through Friday. Considerations to flash the catastrophic disaster and flooding of the city likely for northwest and north Florida and Southeast through Friday.

RECOMMENDED MEASURES ------------------- Actions to protect human souls and property They vary within tsunami advisory areas.  If you are in the tsunami advisory area;  * Move from water, beach, and avoid    docks, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.  * Be vigilant and follow the instructions from your municipality    emergency officials because they may have the details or    specific information on your location.  * If you are aware of a strong earthquake or increasing earthquake    take emergency protective measures such as moving inland    and/or up preferable by foot.  * Boat operators,      * Where time and circumstances allow you to move from your boat to        sea to depth 180 bats.  If it stays far from the sea and enters, it enters the waters and communities.
