RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ------------------- Actions to protect human life and property will vary within tsunami advisory areas.  If you are in a tsunami advisory area;   * Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from    harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.   * Be alert to and follow instructions from your local    emergency officials because they may have more detailed or    specific information for your location.   * If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling    take immediate protective actions such as moving inland    and/or uphill preferably by foot.   * Boat operators,      * Where time and conditions permit move your boat out to        sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.       * If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors,        marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and        submerged debris and strong currents.   * Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.   * Do not return to the coast until local emergency officials    indicate it is safe to do so.   IMPACTS ------- Impacts will vary at different locations in the advisory areas.  If you are in a tsunami advisory area;   * A tsunami with strong waves and currents is possible.   * waves and currents can drown or injure people who are    in the water.   * Currents at beaches and in harbors, marinas,    bays, and inlets may be especially dangerous.   * Some impacts may continue for many hours to days after    arrival of the first wave.   * The first wave may not be the largest so later waves may    be larger.   * Each wave may last 5 to 45 minutes as a wave encroaches    and recedes.   * Coasts facing all directions are threatened because the    waves can wrap around islands and headlands and into bays.   * Strong shaking or rolling of the ground indicates an    earthquake has occurred and a tsunami may be imminent.   * A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and    sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami.   * The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea,    a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave,    as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND NEXT UPDATE --------------------------------------  * Refer to the internet site ntwc.arh.noaa.gov for more    information.   * Pacific coastal residents outside California, Oregon,    Washington, British Columbia and Alaska should refer to the    Pacific Tsunami Warning Center messages at ptwc.weather.gov.   * This message will be updated within 60 minutes.  $$

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials.   A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.   A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.   A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area.   For storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.     DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ---------------------- At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was located near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 83.9 West. Helene is moving toward the north-northeast near 24 mph (39 km/h).  A turn toward the north is expected overnight, taking the center over Georgia.  The center of the hurricane should make landfall very soon in the Big Bend region of Florida.  After landfall, Helene is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.   Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher gusts.  Helene is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on  the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected  after Helene moves inland, but the fast forward speed will allow  strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well  inland across the southeastern United States, including over the  higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.   Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km).  A sustained wind of 64 mph (103 km/h) with a gust to 84  mph (135 km/h) was recently reported at Cedar Key, Florida.   A  gust of 83 mph (134 km/h) was recently reported at Steinhatchee,  Florida.   The estimated minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter  aircraft observations is 938 mb (27.70 inches).  A NOAA National Ocean Service tide gauge located on Cedar Key  recently reported a water level of 7.33 feet above mean higher high  water.     HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml   STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...   Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft Tampa Bay...5-8 ft Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft   The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.   For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.   WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane warning area.  When the eye passes over, people are reminded to not venture out into the relative calm, as hazardous winds will increase very quickly when the eye passes.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in southern and central Florida, and these conditions will continue spreading northward across the tropical storm warning areas in  the Southeastern U.S. through early Friday.  Strong, damaging winds,  especially in gusts, will likely penetrate as far inland as the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.   RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are expected in steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.   For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.   For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link: www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.   TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes continues tonight through early Friday morning over parts of north/central Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and southern North Carolina. The tornado risk will persist Friday across the Carolinas and southern Virginia.   SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

ZCZC MIATCDAT4 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM   Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  15 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024 1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 26 2024   The hurricane is about to make landfall in the Florida Big Bend region.  Timely observations from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed that Helene continued to strengthen rapidly to Category 4 status before it approached the coast, with the central pressure falling at about 3 mb per hour since this afternoon.  Peak 700 mb flight-level winds from the aircraft were 136 kt, corresponding to an intensity of about 120 kt, which might be a bit conservative.  Radar and satellite images show numerous mesocyclones rotating around the eyewall.   The large hurricane continues moving rapidly north-northeastward with the latest initial motion estimated to be 015/21 kt.  A generally northward track is expected overnight, taking the center from southern to northern Georgia through early Friday morning. Later on Friday and Saturday, Helene should slow down considerably while it interacts with a mid-level low to its northwest and west. The weakening system is likely to become nearly stationary in 48-60 hours.  The official track forecast follows the dynamical model consensus.   Although the system will weaken as it moves over land, the fast forward speed of Helene during the next 12 hours or so will result in a far inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern United States, particularly over Georgia, including strong gusts over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians. Accordingly, a higher-than-normal gust factor is indicated in the official forecast while Helene is inland.   KEY MESSAGES:   1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is occurring along portions of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.   2. Catastrophic hurricane-force winds are occurring near the coast within the eyewall of Helene and will spread inland over portions of northern Florida and southern Georgia.   3. Damaging wind gusts will penetrate well inland over portions of Georgia and the Carolinas tonight, particularly over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians. Residents in these areas should be prepared for the possibility of long-duration power outages.  If you use a generator after the storm, be sure it is placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.   4. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, including numerous significant landslides, is expected across portions of the southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for northwestern and northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday. Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river flooding are likely.
