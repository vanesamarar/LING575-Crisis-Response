...SPRING STORM FORECAST TO BRING HEAVY SNOW TO PORTIONS OF WESTERN, 
CENTRAL MINNESOTA...

.Another potent Spring Storm is on tap to arrive on Tuesday lasting 
into Wednesday with heavy snow expected for much of central 
Minnesota. The system will arrive in western Minnesota by Tuesday 
morning with a band of heavy snow expected to begin by the afternoon 
continuing overnight as the system pushes eastwards. Snow quality is 
expected to be on the heavier, slushier side as snow ratios favor 
below 10 to 1. An influx of mid level warm air could also lead to a 
wintry mix at times, with widespread rain to the south of the main 
band of snowfall. Snow will diminish by Wednesday afternoon as the 
system continues into the Great Lakes region. A broad area of 6 or 
more inches of snow is expected for parts of central Minnesota, with 
high end amounts potentially reaching the double digits. Ice 
accumulations should generally remain a glaze to a few hundredths at 
the most.
