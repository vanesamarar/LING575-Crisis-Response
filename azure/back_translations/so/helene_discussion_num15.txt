Hurricane Helene Discussion Discussion Number 15
NWS National Hurricane Miami FL AL092024
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 26 2024
 
The storm is moving to Florida Big Bend
state.  Suggested Attention from Air Force and Typhoon NOAA
Hunter's aircraft showed that Helene had intensified quickly
to their Rank Category 4 status before approaching the coast, with their
central pressure falling at about 3 mb per hour since since
in the afternoon.  Peak 700 mb flight-level wind from the aircraft were
136 kt, corresponding to the intensity of about 120 kt, which may
be a bit conservative.  Radar and satellite images show a large number of
mesocyclones that surrounded the eye wall.
 
The great storm continues apace in the northeast with rapidly
with the last previous motion estimated at 015/21 kt.  A
generally the northbound road is expected at night, and the facility is being taken
from southern to northern Georgia through early Friday morning.
Later on Friday and Saturday, Helene should be substantially reduced
Where it interacts with low-lying low-levels to the northwest and west.
A weakening system may be almost almost tied to 48-60
for hours.  The official track prediction follows the dynamical model
consensus.
 
Although the system weakens as it moves over the ground, quick
helene's forward speed during the next 12 hours or so will result
that the earthquakes far inland with strong winds passed through parts of
the southeastern United States, especially Georgia, including
a bit stronger in the highlands of the southern Appalachians.
Thus daraeded, a factor a higher-than-normal gust factor is indicated in the
the official projection while Helene is inside.
 
IMPORTANT MESSAGES:
 
1. The rise of the catastrophic and deadly storm is happening in different parts
in the Florida Big Bend coast, where fatigue can reach as high
of 20 feet above the ground, along with destructive waves.  It is
it is also a risk of a dangerous storm in the remainder
the west coast of florida island.
 
2-Severe and catastrophic storm winds are occurring near the coast
Inside helene's source columns extending inside parts of
north Florida and southern Georgia.
 
3. Damaging winds storm well will enter more inland than parts of
Georgia and the Carolinas tonight, especially on the high rise
land of the southern Appalachians. Residents living in these areas
must be prepared for the possibility of long-term power
outages.  If you use a generator after the storm, make sure it is
put outdoors at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and
garages to avoid fatal carbon monoxide poisoning.
 
4. Catastrophic flash that threatens life and floods in the city,
including many large earthquakes, expected to end
parts of the appalachians south through Friday. Considerations
to flash the catastrophic disaster and flooding of the city likely for
northwest and north Florida and Southeast through Friday.
Large and large flooding of the river and the large river is isolated
flooding is likely to flood.
