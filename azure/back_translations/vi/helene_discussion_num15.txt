Hunter aircraft show Helene continues to strengthen rapidly
to Class 4 status before it approaches the coast, with
The central pressure drops by about 3 MB per hour from now on
Afternoon.  The highest wind of 700 mb from the plane is
136 kt, which corresponds to an intensity of about 120 kt, can
Be a little conservative.  Radar and satellite imagery shows multiple

Helene's pace of progress over the next 12 hours or so will result in
in a deep penetration of strong winds over areas of

strong gusty winds over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachian.
Accordingly, the higher-than-normal wind gust coefficient is indicated in the
official forecast while Helene was in the mainland.

1. A catastrophic and deadly storm is happening along the sections
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where flooding can reach high

in Helene's eye wall and will spread inland in parts
of northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
3. Damaging gusty winds will penetrate the land on parts of the
