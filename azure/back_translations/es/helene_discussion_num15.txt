Hurricane Helene Discussion Number 15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami, FL AL092024
1100 PM EDT Thu 26 Sep 2024
 
Hurricane is about to make landfall in Florida's Big Bend
region.  Timely Hurricane Observations from the Air Force and NOAA
Hunter aircraft demonstrated that Helene continued to strengthen rapidly
before it approached the coast, with the
central pressure falling at about 3 MB per hour, as
Late.  The aircraft's maximum flight-level winds of 700 mb were
136 kt, which corresponds to an intensity of about 120 kt, which could
Be a little conservative.  Radar and satellite imagery show numerous
mesocyclones that rotate around the wall of the eye.
 
The Great Hurricane Continues to Move Rapidly North-Northeast
with the last initial movement estimated at 015/21 kt.  One
In general, a northward trajectory is expected during the night, taking the center
from south to north Georgia through early Friday morning.
Later on Friday and Saturday, Helene should slow down considerably
while it interacts with a mid-level low to the northwest and west.
The weakened system is likely to become nearly stationary at 48-60
hours.  The official track forecast follows the dynamic model
consensus.
 
Although the system will weaken as it moves over the earth, the speed of the system will be
Helene's forward speed for the next 12 hours or so
at an inland end with strong winds over parts of the
southeastern United States, particularly over Georgia, including
strong gusts over the higher ground of southern Appalachia.
As a result, a higher-than-normal burst factor is indicated in the
official forecast while Helene is inland.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is occurring along parts of the
of Florida's Big Bend coast, where flooding could reach up to
about 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There
it is also a danger of life-threatening storm surges along the rest
off the west coast of the Florida peninsula.
 
2. Catastrophic hurricane-force winds are occurring near the coast
inside the wall of Helene's eye and extend inland over portions
of northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
3. Harmful wind gusts will penetrate well inland over parts of the
Georgia and the Carolinas tonight, particularly over the
southern Appalachian terrain. Residents in these areas
must be prepared for the possibility of long-lasting power
Interruptions.  If you use a generator after the storm, make sure it's
placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and
garages to prevent deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.
 
4. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
including numerous significant landslides, is expected across
parts of southern Appalachia through Friday. Considerable
locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding are likely to
northwest and north Florida and the southeast through Friday.
Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major rivers
Flooding is likely.
