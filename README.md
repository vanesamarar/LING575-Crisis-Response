# LING575-Crisis-Response

This project evaluates Google Translate's (and Microsoft Translator) ability to effectively translate weather alerts from English into other languages.


Data is compiled from the National Weather Service (NWS) Product Translations, NWS Tsunami Products, and National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center's Advisory Archive. NWS provides limited historical English alerts for a finite number of NWS stations in the United States and the National Hurricane Center has advisory archives dating from 1998.
